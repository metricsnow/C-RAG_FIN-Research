## Objective

Implement advanced query features including Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT), date range filtering, document type filtering, metadata-based filtering, and source-specific filtering for precise search refinement.

---

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Boolean Operators**
   - AND, OR, NOT operators in queries
   - Query parsing and validation
   - Complex query support

2. **Filtering Capabilities**
   - Date range filtering
   - Document type filtering
   - Metadata-based filtering
   - Source-specific filtering

3. **Query Builder UI**
   - Visual query builder component
   - Filter selection interface
   - Query syntax documentation

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Boolean operators functional
- [ ] Date range filtering working
- [ ] Document type filtering working
- [ ] Metadata filtering working
- [ ] Query builder UI implemented
- [ ] Query syntax documentation
- [ ] Unit and integration tests passing

---

## Implementation Plan

1. Design query parsing system
2. Implement Boolean operators
3. Implement filtering capabilities
4. Create query builder UI
5. Write tests and documentation
